Goal:
Lvl 3 in Practice
Lvl 2 in Research
Lvl 2 in Problem Solving
Lvl 2 in Projects

By End of May:
Lvl 5 - 6.25 hours per week, 1.25 per day

Combined, that is 25 hours per week.
Working five hours a day, five days a week, this is very achievable, but tough.

Notes:
Week wasn't very productive, so my hours are just lacking this week. Some time spent on apartment projects, mostly the plants, but a lot of time, especially the off-from-work days, seemed to just go towards crashing on the couch feeling unmotivated.  Putting the drawing pad and D&D book on the couch has pushed me towards working on that. Cooking did get done, but I still have a large amount of veggies from CGC that need to get used up before my trip. I did make it to the Peeka meetings all this week, so staying up has been working.
Issues:
 - Severely unmotivated commonly throughout the week.
Idea to Fix:
Post the "I will" message on the fridge and by the couch so I can see and read it when I go there.
 - Lack of hours when at DESC
 - Lack of diversity in what the hours are spent on
Idea to Fix:
Review schedule at the start of every shift, and maybe on the bus as well. Also, make sure to show up on time so I can keep to that schedule
Accomplished:
Got the "I will" mousepad
Completed monitor setup by installing VGA cable
Made it to the Peeka meetings

Notes:
Week went well. Lots of time spent on apartment projects, mostly the plants, and a bit on the monitor setup. Food became a little bit of an issue later on in the week as I haven't cooked meals yet. I tended to goof off or crash after getting home from a shift.
Issues:
Missed Peeka meetings
Idea to Fix:
Get sleep afterwards, later in the afternoon/evening. Maybe even schedule work times in the morning for that day, and sleep into the evening.
Need a better cool-down routine for when I get home. 
Idea to Fix:
Maybe drawing, or listening to music or a podcast/webcast. Or both. If the issue is that I feel lonely, maybe this is a good time to reach out on social media, or read a biography to feel connected. Afterwards, a workout and shower at this time so I go to bed clean.
Accomplished:
Got cigarette from Dion
Sent back bad cables
Ordered "I Will" mousepad
Did three Starting Strength workouts
