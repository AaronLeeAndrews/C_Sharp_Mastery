Abstraction allows making relevant information visible and encapsulation enables a programmer to implement the desired level of abstraction.

Abstraction can be achieved using abstract classes in C#. 
C# allows you to create abstract classes that are used to provide a partial class implementation of an interface. 
Implementation is completed when a derived class inherits from it. Abstract classes contain abstract methods, which are implemented by the derived class. 
The derived classes have more specialized functionality.

The following are some of the key points:

You cannot create an instance of an abstract class
You cannot declare an abstract method outside an abstract class
When a class is declared sealed, it cannot be inherited, abstract classes cannot be declared sealed.
