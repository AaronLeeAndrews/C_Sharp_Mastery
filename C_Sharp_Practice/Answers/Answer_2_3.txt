Longest common subarray in the given two arrays
Given two arrays A[] and B[] of N and M integers respectively, the task is to find the maximum length of equal subarray or the longest common subarray between the two given array.
Examples:
Input: A[] = {1, 2, 8, 2, 1}, B[] = {8, 2, 1, 4, 7}
Output: 3
Explanation:
The subarray that is common to both arrays are {8, 2, 1} and the length of the subarray is 3.
Input: A[] = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1}, B[] = {8, 7, 6, 4, 7}
Output: 0
Explanation:
There is no such subarrays which are equal in the array A[] and B[].

int a_len=A.lenght();
int b_len=B.Lenght();
int count=0;
int prev_count=0;
for(int i=0;i<a_len;i++){
    
    for(int j=0;j<b_len;j++)
    {
        if (A[i]==B[j]){
        count++;
        break;}
        
        
        else{
        if (prev_count<count){
        
        prev_count=count;
        count=0;
        }
        break;
      }
      }
      return count;
